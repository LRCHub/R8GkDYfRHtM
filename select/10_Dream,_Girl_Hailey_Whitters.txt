Standin' all alone in your party dress
Confetti in the floor, hair's all a mess
Yeah, you've been here before
And you're back again somehow

Look around the room, don't know where he is
Just a wallflower wishin' on might-have-been
Well, he might have played The One
But he's playin' you right now

Oh and some get you high, and some leave you low
Make you feel like you can fly, spin you out of control
Well, don't ever lose your shine, no, wherever you go
'Cause you're someone else's dream, girl
Yeah, you're someone else's dream
Someone else's dream, girl

Part of you don't know what you're worth
'Nother part of you knows just what you're worth
So you move on, let go
Find some silver linin'

Try to turn back time like you turn that dial
Light up that spark you ain't burned in a while
Well, maybe tonight
Hell, you might just keep on drivin'

Oh, and some get you high and some leave you low
Make you feel like you can fly, spin you out of control
Well, don't ever lose your shine, no, wherever you go
'Cause you're someone else's dream, girl
Yeah, you're someone else's dream
Someone else's dream, girl

Well, don't ever lose sight of your dream, girl
Never settle for less than you need, girl
You never know where one's gonna be, girl

Some get you high and some leave you low
Make you feel like you can fly, spin you out of control
Don't ever lose your shine, no, wherever you go
'Cause you're someone else's dream, girl
And some get you high and some leave you low
Make you feel like you can fly, spin you out of control
Well, don't ever lose your shine, no, wherever you go
'Cause you're someone else's dream, girl

Yeah, you're someone else's dream
Someone else's dream, girl
